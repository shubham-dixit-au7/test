Question 1) Write a program to find greatest common divisor (GCD) or highest common factor (HCF) of given two numbers.

Answer- Python Code(File- gcd.py)-
                        
                        first = int(input ("Enter First Number -> "))
                        second = int(input ("Enter Second Number -> "))
                            if first > second: 
                                small = second 
                            else: 
                                small = second 
                            for iterable in range(1, small+1): 
                                if((first % iterable == 0) and (second % iterable == 0)): 
                                    gcd = iterable 
                        print ("The gcd of 60 and 48 is : ",gcd) 
                        



Question 2) Take integer inputs from user until he/she presses q ( Ask to press q to quit after every integer input ). 
            Print average and product of all numbers.

Answer- Python Code(File- ques2.py)-

                    count = 0 
                    sum = 0 
                    product = 1 
                    while(True):
                        value = input("Enter a Integer -> ")
                        if (value == 'q'): break
                        value = int(value)
                        sum = sum + value
                        product = product * value
                        count = count + 1
                    print("Average of all inputs are -> ",sum/count)
                    print("Product of all inputs are -> ",product)



Question 3) Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

Answer-Python Code(File- calc_upper_lower.py)

            string = input("Enter a String -> ")
            upper, lower= 0, 0
            for i in string:
                if(i.isupper()):
                    upper=upper+1
                elif(i.islower()):
                    lower=lower+1
            print("Total no. of uppercase characters present in string are " , upper)
            print("Total no. of lowercase characters present in string are " , lower)



Question 4) Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not. 

Answer- Python Code(File- calc_upper_lower.py)-

                        string = input("Enter a String -> ")
                        upper, lower= 0, 0
                        for i in string:
                            if(i.isupper()):
                                upper=upper+1
                            elif(i.islower()):
                                lower=lower+1
                        print("Total no. of uppercase characters present in string are " , upper)
                        print("Total no. of lowercase characters present in string are " , lower)
