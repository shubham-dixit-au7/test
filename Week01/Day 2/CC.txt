Question 1- In python, the size of float and integer is the same in terms of bytes then how is it able to store such large values?

Answer- An int represents its directly corresponding number in binary whereas A float on the other hand is encoded to represent a number in exponential form.


Question 2- How many bits are there in 1GB and 1MB?

Answer- No. of bits in 1 GB and  1 MB are-
                    1 GB= 1024 MB
                    1 MB= 1024 KB
                    1 KB= 1024 B 
                    1 B = 8 bits
                    So,
                    1 GB= 8 * 1024 * 1024 *1024 = 8,589,934,592 bits
                    and,
                    1MB= 8 * 1024 * 1024 = 8,388,608 bits.


Question 3-  write a program that takes input from the user as marks in 5 subjects and assigns a grade according to the following rules:
                Perc = (s1+s2+s3+s4+s5)/5.
                A, if Perc is 90 or more
                B, if Perc is between 70 and 90(not equal to 90)
                C, if Perc is between 50 and 70(not equal to 90)
                D, if Perc is between 30 and 50(not equal to 90)
                E, if Perc is less than 30

Answer- Python Code(File- marks_perc.py)-
                s1=int(input("Enter the Marks of First Subject-"))
                s2=int(input("Enter the Marks of Second Subject-"))
                s3=int(input("Enter the Marks of Third Subject-"))
                s4=int(input("Enter the Marks of Fourth Subject-"))
                s5=int(input("Enter the Marks of Fifth Subject-"))
                perc=(s1+s2+s3+s4+s5)/5
                if (perc >= 90):
                    print("Grade A")
                elif (perc >= 70):
                    print("Grade B")
                elif (perc >= 50):
                    print("Grade C")
                elif (perc >= 30):
                    print("Grade D")
                elif(perc < 30):
                    print("Grade E")
                else:
                    print("Invalid Input.")


Question 4- Build a very basic login system that takes in input from the username password. checks if username is "Priyesh" and password is "password" and responds with:
            -Username Does not Exist
            -Passwords do not match
            -Entered the System

Answer- Python Code(File- login.py)-
        user_name = input ("Enter the Username:")
        if(user_name == "Priyesh"):
            password = input ("Enter the Password:")
            if(password == "password"):
                print("Entered the System")
            else:
                print("Passwords do not match")
        else:
            print("Username Does not Exist")
